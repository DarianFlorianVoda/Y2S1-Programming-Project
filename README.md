# Y2S1-Programming-Project
I made a project where I had a problem with Parking lots.

# Description
The problem consists of an Java application where I created a Parking chain with cars, just like at a simple Real-life parking.
Each Parking Chain has a Parking Lot with one or more entrances. These entrances are divided into zones and each zone has a parking space with their type of car that is allowed.

# Features
Obtain information about occupancy rate at a parking lot;
Offers discount at the 10th time of reusing the parking lot;
Display the information about the gain of the day according to the types of cars;
The program takes the information of Parking chains write in a .txt file which is "Parkings.txt" and will write the information into "Parking_Chain.txt" with Serialization;
A class diagram is shown of how the classes are interacting.
